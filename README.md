## What is QuickerDB?
#### QuickerDB is a wrapper made for the well known NodeJS module "quick.db".

## Is QuickerDB actually "quicker"?
#### Well yes and no, while QuickerDB may not be "quicker" and contains many shortcuts as a workaround to many unncecesary lines of code your project may have!

#### QuickerDB has the optional debug mode which when enabled will log every database action performed, this is handy for people who would like to know what is happening and when.
